# Machine Learning and Spatial Data Final Project
This is the repository for our final project in GEOG 4003 machine learning and spatial data. 

Models are based on a recommendation/prediction model using RNN or matrix facorization, and a classification/regression model to score POIs using gradient boosted trees (XGBoost).
